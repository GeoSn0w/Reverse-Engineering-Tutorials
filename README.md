# Reverse-Engineering-Tutorials
Some Reverse Engineering Tutorials from a beginner for beginners interested in INFOSEC.

I group them by levels, I usually provide a compiled crack-me tool that you need to practice on and a tutorial.
The source code for the crack-me is most of the times available in the level folder. I sometimes also provide precompiled macOS binaries.

Tools you might need during this:
* Radare2: http://radare.org
* Python: https://www.python.org/
* Hopper Disassembler: https://www.hopperapp.com/

Programming knowledge is not required for the lower levels, but might help a lot as you proceed.
